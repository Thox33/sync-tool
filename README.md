## Documentation

We are using Sphinx with the ReadTheDocs html theme.

You have the following ways to run a live reloading server to develop this documentation

- Run `poetry run python docs/docs_livereload.py`
- Run `docker compose up --build docs`

Both will run a webserver listing on http://localhost:5500 and will automatically rebuild the documentation (and
reloading the website inside your browser) if a file in docs or sync_tool directory changes.

(Third option would be to manually call `make html` or `./make.bat html` inside the docs directory.)
